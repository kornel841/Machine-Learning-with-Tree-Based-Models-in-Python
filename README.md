# Machine-Learning-with-Tree-Based-Models-in-Python

## Main goal of study:

Training diffrent models on the same dataset, let each model make its predictions. 

#$ Output

The output shows that the highest accuracy has classifier Logistic Regression with 94.7% accuracy.
However the best performance we have with a Voting Classifier 95.3% accuracy. We instantiate a voting classifier vc by setting the estimators parameter to classifiers.
Fitting vc to the training set yields a test set accuracy of 95.3%. This accuracy is higher than that achieved by any of the individual models in the ensemble.
